    <h1>Welcome to Nick's favorite Books page and why books are epic</h1>

      <h3>
        Reading books are like video games that are more beneficial for you and
        won't get you yelled at as much if you do it when you aren't supposed
        to. :)

      <p>
        I have a wide preference of books and I'm always picking up another book
        once I finish the last. <br />
        (This results in a lot of re-reading books since I don't have an entire
        library at my fingertips.) <br />
