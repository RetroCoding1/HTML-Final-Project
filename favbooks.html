        <h1>Welcome to Nick's favorite Books page and why books are epic</h1>
        <h3>
          Reading books are like video games that are more beneficial for you
          and won't get you yelled at as much if you do it when you aren't
          supposed to. :)

      <p>
        I have a wide preference of books (but mainly fantasy/greek mythology
        such as Percy Jackson) and I'm always picking up another book once I
        finish the last. <br />
        (This results in a lot of re-reading books since I don't have an entire
        library at my fingertips.) <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        The book I'm currently reading: The Serpent's Shadow (author: Rick
        Riordan, go check him out! He makes great books.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Books are still great! They're like video games that you can't control
        but are always exciting to see where it will end up!<br />
        A world with books is a better world than without.
