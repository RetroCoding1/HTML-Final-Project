  <h1>Welcome to Nick's favorite Games n Genres Page</h1>
  </header>
  <p>Out of the five hobbies I listed in the index, gaming is the most fun. 
    I mainly play Roblox, old games (using emulators), and Team Fortress 2 (still fun).</p>
  <p>Video games are an immersive experience that don't always end once you reach the last chapter, if there even is a last chapter!<br>
    Booting up an emulator and playing a tough but rewarding strategy game like Advance Wars or just messing around in a Team Fortress 2<br> 
    2Fort game is one of my greatest sources of fun and best stress relievers. It's one of the things I look forward to after every school day.
